# My Neovim configuration files
These are my personal Neovim configuration files. They include basic support for highlighting and completion. Currently a WIP.

**Requirements:**
* A Nerd font
* Sumneko Lua language server (available on Arch Linux as the package `lua-language-server`)

I'm not using `mason.nvim` to manage my LSPs at the moment, because I'm planning to do that with Nix in the future.
